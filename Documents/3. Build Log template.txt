This is the BUILD LOG document structure for a project (e.g., BuildLog.md).

You will manually append a new section each time a sub-step is completed.

-----------------------

  - Example: src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx
- Files MODIFIED:
  - List each existing file that was changed.
- Dependencies ADDED:

  - Example: npm install axios
- Config changes:
  - Any changes to config files:
    - .env
