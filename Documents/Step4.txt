Step 4.1 — Dashboard Static Layout (Overview Screen)
Description:

* Build the static layout for the main Dashboard screen: top summary cards, chart containers, category breakdown section, and insights panel, matching the structure described in the Master Document’s “Dashboard (Overview)” screen. 
* Use shadcn/Tailwind components to structure cards and chart placeholders, but do not connect any real data or backend calls yet.

Expected Output:

* The `/dashboard` (or equivalent) route displays:

  * A row (or grid) of summary cards for cash balance, income this month, expenses this month, net result, VAT due, and runway.
  * Empty chart areas for income vs expenses and cashflow over time (e.g., divs with “Chart placeholder”).
  * A category breakdown section (pie/bar chart placeholder).
  * An insights panel with static placeholder bullets (e.g., “Insight placeholder 1”).

Testing Instructions:

* Run the dev server and navigate to the Dashboard route.
* Verify that:

  * All summary cards are visible with sensible placeholder labels.
  * Chart containers render correctly and resize with the browser window.
  * Category breakdown and insights sections are clearly separated and visually readable.
* Confirm there are no console errors and no network calls for real data yet.

Dependencies:

* Step 1 — Project Initialization & Environment Setup.

* The `/transactions` (or equivalent) route shows:

  * A filter bar with placeholder controls (date range inputs, category dropdown, status dropdown, search input).
  * A table with columns for Date, Description, Amount, Category, VAT, Status.
  * Either 1–2 hardcoded placeholder rows or a single empty-state row (“No transactions for this period”).
  * A disabled or non-functional “Categorize selected” button at the top or bottom.

Testing Instructions:

* Navigate to the Transactions route via the sidebar.

Expected Output:

* The `/vat` route shows:

  * A period selector control (dropdown or segmented control) with static options like “Current period” and “Previous period”.
  * Cards for Total Output VAT, Total Input VAT, Net VAT Due, each showing placeholder numbers (e.g., “AED —”).

* The `/cashflow` (or similar) route displays:

  * A main chart container reserved for cashflow forecast (no real chart yet).
  * Cards or text blocks for “Burn rate” and “Runway” with placeholder values.
  * A section titled “Upcoming PDCs” with a simple table/list of fake entries or a message “No upcoming PDCs”.
  * A short static note or info area summarizing “Key cash drivers” with placeholder text.

* Include a few static example messages (user + assistant) to demonstrate layout, but no real backend chat yet.

Expected Output:

* The `/chat` (or equivalent) route shows:

  * A scrollable conversation area with at least 2–3 static messages (alternating user/assistant).

* Confirm clicking “Save” or “Invite” buttons does nothing beyond basic visual feedback.

Dependencies:

* Step 3 — Navigation / Routing / Shell.
* Step 2 — Folder & File Structure.

Step 4.8 — Admin Companies List Static Screen
Description:

* Create the static Admin “companies list” screen, matching the “Admin Overview Screen” concept but limited to a table of companies and high-level metrics placeholders, as allowed by Step 4 scope.
