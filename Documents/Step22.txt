Step 22.1 — Audit UI Spacing, Typography, and Color Tokens
Description:
- Review global styles (Tailwind/shadcn) for consistency; adjust spacing/typography scale and color palette per design direction. Document tokens in CSS/tailwind config.
Expected Output:
- Updated globals/tokens; notes on applied design system.
Testing Instructions:
- Visual pass on key pages; ensure no regressions; `npm run lint/build`.
Dependencies:
- Steps 3–7 UI built; existing Tailwind/shadcn setup.

Step 22.2 — Improve Skeletons & Loading States
Description:
- Enhance skeleton components for dashboard, tables, and forms to better match final layouts; ensure consistent usage across pages.
Expected Output:
- Skeletons reflect actual content shapes; applied across main routes.
Testing Instructions:
- Trigger loading states (disable network or add delay) and verify skeleton visuals.
Dependencies:
- Step 3.11 skeletons baseline; Step 5 hooks.

Step 22.3 — Refine Navigation/Sidebar/Header UX
Description:
- Polish sidebar/header: active states, hover, icons, compact mode, responsive behavior. Add small motion/transition effects.
Expected Output:
- Cleaner nav interactions; responsive sidebar/header without layout shifts.
Testing Instructions:
- Navigate across routes; resize window; confirm smooth transitions and no flicker.
Dependencies:
- Steps 3.2–3.5 nav, Step 5 provider.

Step 22.4 — Tables & Forms Styling Pass
Description:
- Standardize table styles (row hover, striping, empty states) and form controls (inputs, selects, buttons) across Transactions, Documents, Settings, Admin.
Expected Output:
- Consistent table/form appearance; clear empty/error states.
Testing Instructions:
- Inspect tables/forms on key pages; verify consistency and readability.
Dependencies:
- Steps 4/12/13/18 UIs present.

Step 22.5 — Charts & Data Viz Polishing
Description:
- Apply cohesive colors, axis/legend styling, and responsive behavior to charts on dashboard/cashflow. Ensure accessible contrast.
Expected Output:
- Charts visually aligned with design system; readable labels/legends.
Testing Instructions:
- View charts on different sizes; check legend readability and contrast.
Dependencies:
- Step 6/16 chart data wired.

Step 22.6 — Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation
Description:
- Add aria labels, focus styles, and keyboard navigation for key components (nav, forms, modals, dropdowns).
Expected Output:
- Improved accessibility with visible focus rings and appropriate aria attributes.
Testing Instructions:
- Tab through pages; verify focus order and accessibility attributes via devtools.
Dependencies:
- Existing components from Steps 3–18.

Step 22.7 — Microcopy & Empty State Improvements
Description:
- Refine copy for empty/error states and helper text across screens to match product tone (professional, clear).
Expected Output:
- Updated text content; consistent tone in empty/error states.
Testing Instructions:
- Browse pages with no data or forced errors; verify updated copy.
Dependencies:
- Prior UI implementations.

Step 22.8 — Performance & Layout Checks
Description:
- Audit for layout shifts, unnecessary re-renders, and oversized assets; optimize images/icons; ensure code-splitting where useful.
Expected Output:
- Reduced layout shift and improved render performance; optimized assets.
Testing Instructions:
- Lighthouse or manual perf check; observe reduced CLS; ensure builds succeed.
Dependencies:
- Existing frontend build.

Step 22.9 — Update Build Log & Cleanup
Description:
- Document Step 22 in `buildlog.md`; remove any debug styles or unused assets.
Expected Output:
- Build log updated; clean stylesheet/components.
Testing Instructions:
- `npm run lint`/`npm run build`; visual smoke test.
Dependencies:
- Steps 22.1–22.8.
